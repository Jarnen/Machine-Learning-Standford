# About
This repository contains exercises for my Machine Learning Course by Standford University from Coursera.

# How to Explore and Use
These exercises use Octave1 or MATLAB, a high-level programming language well-suited for numerical computations. 
If you do not have Octave or MATLAB installed, please refer to the installation instructions in the Environment 
Setup Instructions" of the course website. 

# For Further Help
At the Octave/MATLAB command line, typing help followed by a function name displays documentation for a built-in 
function. For example, help plot will bring up help information for plotting. Further documentation for Octave 
functions can be found at the Octave documentation pages.
